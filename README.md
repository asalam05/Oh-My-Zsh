## ðŸ§© Shell Completion Setup

This setup uses static completion scripts for CLI tools to ensure fast and reliable autocompletion. Completion scripts for `aws`, `eksctl`, and `kubectl` are generated once and stored in `zsh/completions/`. The `.zshrc` sources these files:

```sh
[ -f "$HOME/Scripts/dotfiles/zsh/completions/aws.zsh" ] && source "$HOME/Scripts/dotfiles/zsh/completions/aws.zsh"
[ -f "$HOME/Scripts/dotfiles/zsh/completions/eksctl.zsh" ] && source "$HOME/Scripts/dotfiles/zsh/completions/eksctl.zsh"
[ -f "$HOME/Scripts/dotfiles/zsh/completions/kubectl.zsh" ] && source "$HOME/Scripts/dotfiles/zsh/completions/kubectl.zsh"
```

The `install.sh` script will automatically generate these completion files if the tools are installed. If you update a tool, re-run the install script to refresh its completion.

## ðŸ”§ AWS CLI Configuration

To disable paging for AWS CLI output in every session, the following is set in `.zshrc`:

```sh
export AWS_PAGER=""
```

This ensures AWS CLI output is always shown directly in your terminal, without paging.
