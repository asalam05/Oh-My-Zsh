## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your system has the following installed:

* `git`
* `zsh`
* `curl` or `wget`
* `sudo` access (the script installs packages)
* A [**Nerd Font**](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) (e.g., MesloLGS NF) installed and enabled in your terminal for icons to render correctly.

### Installation on a New Machine

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    # Clone it to a location of your choice
    git clone git@github.com:asalam05/Oh-My-Zsh.git
    ```
2.  **Run the installation script:**
    ```sh
    bash install.sh
    ```

The script will handle the rest. Once it's finished, **restart your terminal** to apply all changes.
